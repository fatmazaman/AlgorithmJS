# Annoying Popup

This project demonstrates a simple HTML file with JavaScript that creates an annoying popup that moves randomly around the screen. You can use this for educational purposes to understand how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You will see an annoying popup moving randomly on the screen.

## Stopping the Annoying Popup

If you want to stop the annoying popup after a certain time, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2. Uncomment the line inside the `<script>` tag that includes `setTimeout`.
3. Adjust the time in milliseconds according to your preference.
4. Save the file and refresh the browser.

The annoying popup will now stop after the specified time.
