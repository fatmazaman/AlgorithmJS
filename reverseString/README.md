# Reverse the string

### Algorithm 1:
1. Convert String into array.
2. reverse the array by method called reverse().
3. convert array into string.
4. return the string.

#### Don't cheat with reverese() Method.

### Algorithm 2:
1. create an empty string.
2. iterate over given string and start puting the characater one by one into empty string.
3. return reversed string.

### Algorithm 3:(Algo 1+ Algo2)
1. Convert String into an array.
2. Use reduce() Method to reduce the array into single value.
3. Return the reduced array.

### Algorithm 4: ( Fatma's Logic)
1. Convert String into an array
2. Define the length of array (n)
3. if length of array is even(n%2 == 0) then recursive function
4. if length of array is odd(n%2 == 1) then recursive function
