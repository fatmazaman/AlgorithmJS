# Reverse the string

### Algorithm 1:
1.Convert String into array.
2.reverse the array by method called reverse().
3.convert array into string.
4.return the string.


#### Don't cheat with reverese() Method.

### Algorithm 2 :
1.create an empty string.
2.iterate over given string and start puting the characater one by one into empty string.
3.return reversed string.


### Algorithm 3:(Algo1 + Algo2)
