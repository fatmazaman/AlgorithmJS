### Big-O Notation 
- Implementtaion of an algorithm with respect to both time(execution time) and space(memeory consumed)
- The Big-O nottaions measures the worst-case compelexity, ananlyze and compare the efficiency of an algorithms. 
- n represenets the number of input - "What will happen as n approaches infinity?"
- O(1) is holy
- O(1) --> O(log n) Logarithmic --> O(n)Linear --> O(n^2) Quadratic --> O(n^3)n Cubic --> O(n^n) Exponential.
