# Keylogger Example

This example demonstrates a basic keylogger implemented in JavaScript for educational purposes. It captures keypress events in the browser, logs the pressed key to the console, and optionally sends the key to a server using AJAX.

## Explanation

- The script captures keypress events in the browser using `document.onkeypress`.
- It retrieves the pressed key and logs it to the browser console.
- Optionally, it sends the key to a server using AJAX.
- Adjust the server endpoint and handling on the server side based on your requirements.

**Note**: Keyloggers or capturing user input without consent are generally considered unethical. Always ensure you have user consent and follow ethical practices. This example is for educational purposes only.
